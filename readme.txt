Adds Kickstarter to the list of supported oEmbed providers.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to more easily embed [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) project videos on your WordPress site.

To embed a project video, simply paste the URL to your Kickstarter project on its own line in the editor. WordPress will do the rest.

If the project has no video, Kickstarter will instead send a widget with the project image, status, description, and some stats.

== Installation ==

1. Search for 'Kickstarter Video Embed' from the Plugins > Add New screen.
2. Install and activate the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. Kickstarter embed preview in the editor (4.0+).
2. Kickstarter embed link in the editor (3.9-).
3. Kickstarter embed displayed on the front of the site.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First version, registers the oEmbed endpoint for project videos.
